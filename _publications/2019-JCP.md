Electroconvective flow between two infinitely long parallel electrodes is investigated via a multiphysics computational model. The model solves for spatiotemporal flow properties using two-relaxation-time Lattice Boltzmann Method for fluid and charge transport coupled to Fast Fourier Transport Poisson solver for the electric potential. The segregated model agrees with the previous analytical and numerical results providing a robust approach for modeling electrohydrodynamic flows.
