Convection is a fundamental fluid transport phenomenon, where the large-scale motion of a fluid is driven, for example, by a thermal gradient or an electric potential. Modelling convection has given rise to the development of chaos theory and the reduced-order modelling of multiphysics systems; however, these models have been limited to relatively simple thermal convection phenomena. In this work, we develop a reduced-order model for chaotic electroconvection at high electric Rayleigh number. The chaos in this system is related to the standard Lorenz model obtained from Rayleighâ€“Benard convection, although our system is driven by a more complex three-way coupling between the fluid, the charge density, and the electric field. Coherent structures are extracted from temporally and spatially resolved charge density fields via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). A nonlinear model is then developed for the chaotic time evolution of these coherent structures using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, constrained to preserve the symmetries observed in the original system. The resulting model exhibits the dominant chaotic dynamics of the original high-dimensional system, capturing the essential nonlinear interactions with a simple reduced-order model.
