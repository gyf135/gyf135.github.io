Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrust is produced when ionized fluid is accelerated in an electric field due to the momentum transfer between the charged species and neutral molecules. We extend the previously reported analytical model that couples space charge, electric field and momentum transfer to derive thrust force in one-dimensional planar coordinates. The electric current density in the model can be expressed in the form of Mottâ€“Gurney law. After the correction for the drag force, the EHD thrust model yields good agreement with the experimental data from several independent studies. The EHD thrust expression derived from the first principles can be used in the design of propulsion systems and can be readily implemented in the numerical simulations.
