We present an analytical model for electro-hydrodynamic flow that describes the relationship between the corona voltage, electric field, and ion charge density. The interaction between the accelerated ions and the neutral gas molecules is modeled as an external body force in the Navier-Stokes equation. The gas flow characteristics are solved from conservation principles with spectral methods. This multiphysics model is shown to match experimental data for a point-to-ring corona configuration, shedding new insights into mass, charge, and momentum transport phenomena, and can be readily implemented in any numerical simulation.
